The Visiting Card Scanner is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to scan and extract text from images of visiting or business cards using the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine.
This tool is designed to simplify the process of digitizing contact information from physical business cards.
